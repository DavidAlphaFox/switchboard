# Switchboard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thusfresh/switchboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thusfresh/switchboard)

Switchboard is a framework for processing email. It consists of a core that
maintains a connection to an IMAP server and routes event notifications to a
set of workers. The workers interact with the IMAP server through a simple API
exposed by the Switchboard core.
