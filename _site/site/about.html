<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p><em>Switchboard</em> was born out of our (the <a href="http://spatch.co">Spatch</a>
team) need for a cloud based email processing framework. We started
working in early 2014 with <a href="http://pocketknife.io">Thomas Moulia</a> who
led the architecting and development process. In June 2014, we made
Switchboard available as open source project with the aim to free
developers from the plumbing of server-side email processing, allowing
them to focus on creating innovative and useful email plugins. We
believe sharing these core tools is in keeping with the open and
decentralized tradition of email. We believe that email and
communication can be improved by working together so all are welcome
to contribute to the Switchboard core and to create and share new and
innovative plugins. Switchboard is and always will be a liberally
licensed open source project.</p>

<p><em>Spatch</em> is an innovative startup working on redefining the way digital
communication works. Email’s ubiquity and decentralized architecture
are it’s greatest strengths and the reason it has yet to be
replaced. However, managing and acting upon the deluge of messages is
still an antiquated and burdensome process, requiring major human
effort to handle what should be simple. Spatch solves this fundamental
issue by re-thinking how communication works and in particular by
focusing on structuring context within messages.</p>
