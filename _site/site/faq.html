<h3 id="how-do-i-keep-the-switchboard-interfaces-secure">How do I keep the Switchboard interfaces secure?</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that emails are highly sensitive. A Switchboard
application is only as secure as the server which it is on. Beyond
personal use, great care should be taken to ensure that both
Switchboard and its environment are secure.</p>

<p>When deploying Switchboard, you <em>must</em> understand the differences
between the <a href="/interfaces">worker and client</a> interfaces. Unless
you have a good reason otherwise, the worker interface should
never be publicly exposed.</p>

<p>To have control over what interfaces are exposed, it is recommended
that Switchboard’s client port, <code>8080</code> by default, is closed to
external connections. Individual interfaces can be exposed using an
HTTP server’s

<h3 id="why-is-switchboard-unable-to-perform-a-plain-login-for-my-gmail-account">Why is Switchboard unable to perform a PLAIN LOGIN for my Gmail account?</h3>

<p>If you are unable to loin to a Gmail account using <code>PLAIN</code>
authorization it could be because of Google’s fraud
detection. Usually, the flagged login must be from a different
geographic location, a remote server, or a proxy. The error should
provide a URL where you can confirm that you initiated the login
attempt.</p>

<!-- TODO - include shell -->

<p>You also won’t be able to login using PLAIN authorization if you are
using Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/2step/">2-step
verification</a> without an
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en">application-specific password</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-imap-connections-does-switchboard-use">How many IMAP connections does Switchboard use?</h3>

<p>For each account, one IMAP connection is created for sending commands,
plus one IMAP connection for each mailbox to be monitored. This
separation of responsibilites across IMAP connections allows for
simpler management of the IMAP connections, though at the cost of
<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/97150?hl=en">using multiple IMAP connections</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-just-imapidle">Why not just IMAP+IDLE?</h3>

<p>While the Switchboard API provides some IMAP+IDLE like functionality,
it is specifically intended to take the pain out of real time email
processing across many users. IMAP is a sharp, if sometimes low-level
and difficult, tool and will remain preferable for general purpose
email tasks.</p>
