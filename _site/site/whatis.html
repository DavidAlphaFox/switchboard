<h2 id="what-is-switchboard">What is Switchboard?</h2>

<p>Switchboard provides high-level tools for managing IMAP clients across
multiple email accounts and providers, and an API allowing external
workers to process emails as they arrive. It handles the boilerplate
of IMAP connection management and new email monitoring so that you can
focus on innovating around email.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul class="bulletPoints1">
<li>
  Totally open source &mdash; developers can extend Switchboard or use
  the API to create workers specific to their product.
</li>
<li>
  Switchboard handles the boilerplate, leaving the logic to you
  &mdash; Swtichboard frees you from the plumbing of server-side email
  monitoring and fetching, allowing you to focus on your products
  and services.
</li>
<li>
  You deploy it &mdash; by running persistent processes on your own server,
  Switchboard can help you avoid mobile OS backgrounding restrictions
  and heavy battery consumption, freeing up the client and leaving
  you in control.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

<p>You could use Switchboard to help you:</p>

<ul class="bulletPoints1">

  </li>

  <li>
    Store email image attachments to a Dropbox folder. Switchboard can
    upload attachments incoming emails to Dropbox.
  </li>

  <li>
    Unsubscribe from unwanted mailing lists. Given the code
    to select unwanted emails and follow their unsubscribe link,
    Switchboard can remove you from unwanted mailing lists as their
    emails arrive
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Switchboard can do all these things at the same time across a set of
email accounts, with each use case implemented as a separate worker.</p>
