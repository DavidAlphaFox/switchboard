* TODO give imap.erl states
  see https://github.com/akheron/cpython/blob/5bd36f147642ed6d8237785ad3c7d69d702e5832/Lib/imaplib.py#L57
  for command to state mapping

* DONE allow multiple commands to be issued
  Maintain a gb_tree of Tag -> {Pid, Cmd}

* DONE separate tokenizing and parsing (my tokenizer is more of a lexer)

* DONE async + sync API (call v cast)

* TODO add documentation for adding an IMAP command
  I want to keep this to one file, so I won't be able to make it
  extensible via behaviors. Instead, let's make it as easy as
  possible to extend with additional commands.

* TODO get add/drop account supervision tree working like a charm
